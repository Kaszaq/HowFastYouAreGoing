# How fast are you going #

This is a library that helps analyze data from Jira. Once connected to jira, it pulls all issue data for requested project to cache. 
This allows very quick data analysis without requirement to pull data from server each time you run your project. Moreover if any 
data was updated in jira it will be automatically synchronized with local cache - only issues that did change will be pulled from the server.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
